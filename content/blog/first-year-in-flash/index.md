Hello everyone, this is where I begin my blogging

2 years in TKM was better than expected, I didn't even realise how time went by
that and now I'm stuck at home due to lockdown. To be honest I never really
expected to end up in TKM, I am excited to get an EC but hardly I got CS at TKM,
at first when I joined college I was a bit depressed, but everything changed
after a few weeks, At first my thought was to do many projects and all those
stuff related to academics, Later I realised that there many things in between
to do in a college. I guess like it was not late but still I need to figure out
things in college,

These are the things that is in my mind

## Hackathons

Actually by end of first year we managed to form a team with similar thoughts
but doesn't even know where to start with, major aim for the second year is to
learn and win atleast one hackathon. From my side it was somewhat a big task to
beat teams which has larger potential compared to us but it's not impossible.

Later our team SEMI : has paticipated Make-A-Ton which was conducted by CUSAT we
managed to participate in it, we failed. Times went by TKM has conducted a
hackathon as a part of Travancore Hub Meet THM, due to lack of participants we
split up to 5 teams and managed to present our idea and my team got Second. But
still my dream was to get a first with SEMI :, we have applied for Smart India
Hackathon but we didn't get a chance to appear. Thus we reached Reboot Kerala
Hackathon conducted by Govt. Of Kerala.

The mentors was so helpful to guide us and our idea conveyed very effectively
and finally our dream got achieved we got first as well selected for second
round, Second round not yet completed and till then we are in a **_hall of
fame_**. Sometimes this maybe the last hackathon with this team everybody has
assigned their own works and need to focus on that

## Robotics Club

TKM has a community for robotics enthusiasts, but its an emerging one doesn't
even a brand enough to know by peoples of TKM itself, So I got an opportunity to
work for the club as a first year representative. Doesn't know where to start
with and what to do major issue is with the money for the electronics as well as
hardware parts. Not enough capacity to get funded.

In 2020, the plans to raise fund was initiated but issues was existed from start
now its locked everywhere and I am not able to focus on, sometimes I may drop or
assign someone who is more deserving and apt. The club has given me an open
space to interact with seniors who has similar views as me.

## Machine Learning

From the day when I reached the dept, I was continuesly hearing the term ML,
That eagerness made me go through a course on ML by Andrew Ng in Coursera, but
it was too lengthy and complex with few weeks purely based on Linear Algebra.
Thus I just stopped it for a while but managed to obtain a certificate (Don't
ask me how its a secret)

## NSS

National Service Scheme, the only one which inspires me ever since i heard it
from Plus 2, The memories which push me back to the nostalgia of Plus 2 NSS has
a leading role, Thus the spirit made me to apply for NSS, now I'm a proud
volunteer who has many friends in different corners of TKM,

The loving memories of NSS is always the 7 day camp, It can't be worded but can
be felt.

On the professional and developer side
