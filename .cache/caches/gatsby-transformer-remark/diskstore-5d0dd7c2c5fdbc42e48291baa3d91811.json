To be honest I never really\nexpected to end up in TKM, I am excited to get an EC but hardly I got CS at TKM,\nat first when I joined college I was a bit depressed, but everything changed\nafter a few weeks, At first my thought was to do many projects and all those\nstuff related to academics, Later I realised that there many things in between\nto do in a college. I guess like it was not late but still I need to figure out\nthings in college,</p>\n<p>These are the things that is in my mind</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/3610f2af5a4077a4d396f4229207b209/47311/reboot.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 60.13513513513513%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"`Team Semi :`\"\n        title=\"`Team Semi :`\"\n        src=\"/static/3610f2af5a4077a4d396f4229207b209/1c72d/reboot.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3610f2af5a4077a4d396f4229207b209/a80bd/reboot.jpg 148w,\n/static/3610f2af5a4077a4d396f4229207b209/1c91a/reboot.jpg 295w,\n/static/3610f2af5a4077a4d396f4229207b209/1c72d/reboot.jpg 590w,\n/static/3610f2af5a4077a4d396f4229207b209/a8a14/reboot.jpg 885w,\n/static/3610f2af5a4077a4d396f4229207b209/47311/reboot.jpg 1080w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">`Team Semi :`</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<h2 id=\"Hackathons\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Hackathons\" aria-label=\"Hackathons permalink\" class=\"gatsby-remark-autolink before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Hackathons</h2>\n<p>Actually by end of first year we managed to form a team with similar thoughts\nbut doesn't even know where to start with, major aim for the second year is to\nlearn and win atleast one hackathon. From my side it was somewhat a big task to\nbeat teams which has larger potential compared to us but it's not impossible.</p>\n<p>Later our team SEMI : has paticipated Make-A-Ton which was conducted by CUSAT we\nmanaged to participate in it, we failed. Times went by TKM has conducted a\nhackathon as a part of Travancore Hub Meet THM, due to lack of participants we\nsplit up to 5 teams and managed to present our idea and my team got Second. But\nstill my dream was to get a first with SEMI :, we have applied for Smart India\nHackathon but we didn't get a chance to appear. Thus we reached Reboot Kerala\nHackathon conducted by Govt. Of Kerala.</p>\n<p>The mentors was so helpful to guide us and our idea conveyed very effectively\nand finally our dream got achieved we got first as well selected for second\nround, Second round not yet completed and till then we are in a <strong><em>hall of\nfame</em></strong>. Sometimes this maybe the last hackathon with this team everybody has\nassigned their own works and need to focus on that</p>\n<h2 id=\"Robotics-Club\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Robotics-Club\" aria-label=\"Robotics Club permalink\" class=\"gatsby-remark-autolink before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Robotics Club</h2>\n<p>TKM has a community for robotics enthusiasts, but its an emerging one doesn't\neven a brand enough to know by peoples of TKM itself, So I got an opportunity to\nwork for the club as a first year representative. Doesn't know where to start\nwith and what to do major issue is with the money for the electronics as well as\nhardware parts. Not enough capacity to get funded.</p>\n<p>In 2020, the plans to raise fund was initiated but issues was existed from start\nnow its locked everywhere and I am not able to focus on, sometimes I may drop or\nassign someone who is more deserving and apt.
