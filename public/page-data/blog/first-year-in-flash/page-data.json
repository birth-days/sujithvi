To be honest I never really\nexpected to end up in TKM, I am excited to get an EC but hardly I got CS at TKM,\nat first when I joined college I was a bit depressed, but everything changed\nafter a few weeks, At first my thought was to do many projects and all those\nstuff related to academics, Later I realised that there many things in between\nto do in a college.
